# Lab practice 4

Lab practice 4 is about one use case:

1. Use Case 13 of the [DeepHealth EU project](https://deephealth-project.eu)
   based on the [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database](https://physionet.org/lightwave/?db=chbmit/1.0.0),
   and already presented in [Lab practice 1](../pract_1)


## Work to do in this lab practice

1. Access to data and notebooks via the links provided via PoliformaT


2. Configure your Google account to use Google Colab


The code contains comments to guide students and configuration variables students
have to change in order to run experiments.

In this last lab practice, students should use the different models provided in
the code as the starting point to design new ones and explore more possiblities
while trying to get better results than the ones obtained so far.
